        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Alex Lee, and Iâ€™m originally from Los Angeles, California. Currently, Iâ€™m enrolled as a sophomore at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), where I am majoring in Pre-Business. I live conveniently close to campus, which makes my commute to classes and other activities very manageable; it only takes about five minutes to get to most places around the university. Iâ€™ve really come to appreciate this proximity because itâ€™s allowed me to feel more connected to campus life and actively engage in various aspects of the university community.

During my time at UCR so far, Iâ€™ve taken on a part-time job working at the Glasgow dining hall on campus. This job has been more than just a way to earn money; itâ€™s offered me the chance to interact with a wide range of people from different backgrounds. I truly enjoyed my time there, as I made many new friends and learned a lot about working in a team environment. Balancing work and academics has certainly been a challenge, especially when coursework becomes demanding, but Iâ€™ve managed to juggle my responsibilities successfully. Working on campus gave me a new perspective on time management and self-discipline, which I believe will benefit me in the long run.
<br><br>

        Beyond academics and work, Iâ€™ve also been able to build friendships with people who share my interests. One of my favorite ways to unwind and stay active is by playing pickleball, which Iâ€™ve been doing with friends a few times a week. Itâ€™s been a fun way to connect, relieve stress, and stay physically active, all while creating some fantastic memories. Iâ€™m grateful to have found such a supportive and fun group, and I hope to continue nurturing these friendships as I progress through my time at UCR. My goal is to graduate on time while also fully enjoying the experience of meeting new people, forming meaningful connections, and making the most of what UCR has to offer.
<br><br>

        In addition to my studies and campus involvement, I am also a proud member of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) program, based at California State University, San Bernardino. As part of Detachment 002, I dedicate time twice a week to fulfill my ROTC obligations. One of these days is reserved for physical training (PT), while the other is for Lead Lab, which requires a full day of focus and commitment. Balancing my ROTC responsibilities with academic demands and maintaining my social connections has been challenging, but I am determined to adapt and manage my time effectively. I recognize that as I continue my journey in AFROTC, things may only become more challenging, yet Iâ€™m ready to take on that challenge because I know the program is highly beneficial.

Participating in ROTC has opened my eyes to the unique benefits and responsibilities that come with the possibility of commissioning as an officer. My ambition is to pursue a career as a pilot in the United States Air Force, and I believe that the discipline, skills, and leadership training provided by the AFROTC program will be invaluable in reaching that goal. Currently, Iâ€™m in my first year of the program, and Iâ€™ve already developed close friendships with some of my fellow cadets. These relationships mean a great deal to me, and I hope that they will continue to grow and become
